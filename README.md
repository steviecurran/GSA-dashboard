# Global Sales Analysis dashboard

My first dashboard where I use python to recreate the dashboard in a Power BI assignment 

Initially I tried Power BI, but being a Mac user this was not straightforward: 
Running Windows 10 on a virtual machine, Power BI was painfully slow on my 2009 iMac and there is (as yet) not a version compatible with my 2020 Mac Book Air (Apple M Series Chip). I therefore opted for Python Dash to build the first report required by the course -- [The Complete Power BI Practical Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-power-bi-practical-course/).
